## Research Abstract
[目的/意义]学术评价在人才遴选,项目评审和科技政策制定等方面发挥着关键作用.随着"破五唯"改革深入,代表作评价制度作为一种新型评价模式日益受到关注,但目前仍缺乏系统的定量分析支撑.
[方法/过程]提出以"代表作篇均被引量"作为科学家学术影响力的定量表征.基于微软学术数据库(MAG),对物理学,化学和生理学或医学领域的301位诺贝尔奖得主及2518位对照组科学家进行实证分析.通过相关性分析,均值差异比较,识别率,平均排名及逻辑回归等多维度验证该评价模式的有效性.
[结果/结论]①基于代表作的评价模式相较于传统的h指数等计量指标具有更高的区分效度;②该指标与诺奖得主评价的专家判断具有较高一致性;③该评价模式在不同学科领域均展现出良好的适用性.文章为科学家学术影响力的量化评价提供了新的理论框架和实证依据,对推进学术评价体系改革具有重要的理论价值和实践指导意义.
[局限]主要针对自然科学领域成熟科学家群体,对人文社科领域及青年学者的适用性有待进一步验证.
[Purpose/significance]Academic evaluation plays a key role in talent selection,project assessment,and science and technology policy formulation.With the deepening of the"breaking the five-only"reform,the representative work evaluation system has garnered increasing attention as a new evaluation model.However,there is currently a lack of systematic quantitative analysis to support it.[Method/process]This study introduces"average citations per representative work"as a quantitative indica-tor of scientists'academic impact.Drawing from the Microsoft Academic Database(MAG),301 Nobel Prize laureates in Physics,Chemistry,and Physiology or Medicine,alongside 2518 control group scientists,were selected as research subjects.By analyzing the distribution of paper outputs,the top five papers ranked by citation frequency in descending order were identified as representa-tive works.Multiple statistical methods were applied to conduct the empirical analysis.[Result/conclusion]①Compared to tradi-tional bibliometric indicators such as the h-index,the evaluation model based on representative works demonstrates superior discrimi-nant validity.②The indicator shows strong alignment with expert judgments of Nobel Prize winners.③The evaluation model displays robust applicability across different academic disciplines.This study provides a novel theoretical framework and empirical basis for the quantitative evaluation of scientists'academic impact,delivering valuable theoretical and practical guidance for academic evaluation system reforms.[Limitations]This study primarily focuses on mature scientists within the natural sciences,and further validation is needed regarding its applicability to the humanities,social sciences,and early-career researchers.
